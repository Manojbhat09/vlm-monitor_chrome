## What Makes Screen Scoutr Special?

Screen Scoutr goes beyond simple screenshot functionality by incorporating intelligent visual analysis. Whether you're monitoring for specific UI elements, tracking visual changes over time, or setting up alerts for particular content patterns, Screen Scoutr leverages vision language models (VLMs) to bring context-aware intelligence to your browsing experience.

## Getting Started

1. Pin the extension to your browser toolbar for easy access
2. Click on the extension button using your **Right** Mouse Button
3. Select `Options` from the context menu
4. Configure your preferred capture, analysis, and alert settings

## How to Use

### Setting Up API Access

1. **API Key Configuration**:
   - Navigate to the Settings tab in the extension
   - Enter your API key in the designated field
   - Without an API key, the VLM analysis features will not be available

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose from the dropdown menu of available models
   - Free models from Open Router are included by default
   - Pro tip: If you need a specific model that's not listed, use the "Request New Model" button
   - The model list is regularly updated with new options

### Single Image Analysis

1. **Capture Screen Content**:
   - Ensure you're on the tab you want to analyze
   - Click "Select Area" to manually define a region, or
   - Click "Capture Viewport" to automatically capture the entire visible area

2. **Add Context (Optional)**:
   - In the provided text field, enter any prompts or questions
   - Leave blank if you want the VLM to analyze without specific guidance

3. **Analyze the Image**:
   - Click the "Analyze Image" button
   - After processing (timing varies by model), results will appear below the image preview

### Continuous Monitoring

1. **Setup Monitoring**:
   - Navigate to the "Monitor" tab in the extension
   - Select the monitoring interval (minimum: 10 seconds)
   - Enter your monitoring prompt (e.g., "Alert me if this value changes")

2. **Start Monitoring**:
   - Click "Start Monitoring" to begin the automated analysis
   - The extension will capture and analyze the selected screen area at your specified interval

3. **Control Options**:
   - "Pause Monitoring" - Temporarily halt the process
   - "Stop Monitoring" - End the current monitoring session completely

### Viewing History

1. Access the "History" tab to review all previous analyses
2. Results are organized chronologically with timestamps
3. Filter or search through your history to find specific results

### Important Usage Notes

- **Window & Tab Management**:
  - The extension captures the **active tab** in the **active window**
  - If you switch tabs within the monitored window, the new active tab will be captured
  - For uninterrupted monitoring, keep the target tab active in its window
  - You can open a new browser window for other work while monitoring continues

- **API Quota Limitations**:
  - Free Open Router accounts: 50 requests per day per API key
  - For additional usage, you can create new accounts with new API keys
  - Unlimited quota available for Pro users (subject to rate limits)

- **Best Practices**:
  - For critical monitoring, consider using a dedicated browser window
  - More specific prompts generally yield more useful analysis results
  - Regular monitoring intervals (1-5 minutes) provide good coverage without excessive API usage
